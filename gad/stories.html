  <h2> Quinn's Story</h2>
  <p> My name is Quinn. <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-blue"> I have had a Generalised Anxiety Disorder since I was seven years old,</strong> <strong> and have lived with it for the past 13 years. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> When I was younger, I would wake up every morning feeling sick in the stomach, which caused me to be late for school, and on many occasions </strong><strong>  missed days off school sick.</strong> </p>
  <p> My mum took me to the GP who did numerous tests on me. I was even sent to a specialist for an endoscopy. All the tests came back negative. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> The GP said I was suffering from an anxiety disorder.</strong></p>
  <p> My anxiety caused me to suffer from lack of sleep due to all the “what if” questions. It stopped me from going to school camps and sleep overs. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> I missed the enjoyment of a normal childhood due to constant worrying about anything and everything. </strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light">I was referred to Macquarie University where I started in a program for children with anxiety. It was then I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder.</i> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> The program was held over a number of weeks.</strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-blue"> I met some really nice kids who were going through the same things as me, so we could relate to each other.</strong> The program not only taught us how to get our anxiety under control, it also gave us strategies to use if and when we were stressed, tired or unwell. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> Those were the times when my anxiety would rear it’s ugly head again. </strong></p>
  <p> Although my treatment was 12 years ago and I would say my anxiety is 98% under control, I still have days where I am feeling a bit more than a little anxious. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> I often talk to my mum about the silly thoughts that I have. She usually says,</strong><i class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> “now is that a real worry? Has it happened yet? Well don’t worry about things that haven’t happened yet, life is too short to worry about those things.” </i></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular">Although I know this to be true, I do have times where I do worry about the future. </strong>I know that no amount of worry is going to change things in my life. <strong class="text-effra-light">With the help of my mum, I am going well and just need to stay on top of the anxiety and get rid of it altogether.</strong> <strong>Easier said than done, but it’s something I’m working hard on and putting my learned skills into practice.</strong></p>
  
  <h2> Ryan's Story </h2>
  <p> By time I was 18 years old, I had already endured five years of suffering alone with generalised anxiety disorder. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> I matured into my teenage years, the increasing weight of anxiety uncomfortably resting on my chest, my ability to speak out flickered like a weak flame.</strong> <i class="text-effra-light"> Like a python securing its prey: with each attempt I made to struggle free, the tighter the grip became.</i></p>  
  <p> <i class="text-jubilat-regular-blue"> I needed to be liberated from this vice-like hold. The problem I faced with my invisible perpetrator was that I knew very little about its weaknesses, and I was convinced that nobody else knew either.</i> I began withdrawing from those closest to me. <strong> I was scared of hurting other people through actions which were out of my control. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> I decided to push as many people away from me as possible.</strong> <i class="text-effra-regular"></strong>It was brutal for me because I couldn’t justify why I was acting this way to the people who deserved to know the most. </i></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold-blue">When you’re isolated and live within the constraints of your own mind, it’s difficult to see any way out of this prison. </strong> <strong>Anxiety makes you feel different from other people around you. </strong> You feel angry, emotionally exhausted and it makes everyday life excruciatingly painful to endure.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> know, because I’ve been there; I’ve been right where you are.</strong> <strong class="text-effra-regular">Until you decide what is worth more to you, pain or your happiness, this dense atmosphere will continue to work its way into any remaining courage and strength you have reserved in your heart. </strong> </p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light">After five years of living in excruciating pain, on my 19th birthday that I decided to take this thing on head first.  </strong> <i class="text-effra-regular">I had an epiphany about my suffering; I have the strength to endure this level of pain every day, from the moment I wake up, until I go to sleep. </i> <strong>What if I could redirect that strength and focus that energy on my recovery?</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue">first step was removing anxiety’s advantage over me: its invisibility. </strong> I decided to humanise my illness: I called the collective experience of anxiety my gremlins. Gremlins can be defeated, they can be trained and they can be managed.<strong>Once I humanised anxiety, I started to focus on what made it angry,</strong><strong class="text-effra-bold"> what made it incredibly hard to control and when it was at ease, and I learned behaviours.</strong> </p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> Finally, I was willing to speak about what was going on in my head.</strong><strong class="text-effra-light">The first time I admitted that I wasn’t alright out loud was the most terrifying experience of my life, but it’s the reason why I’m alive right now. </strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> Anxiety makes everyday life excruciatingly painful. I communicate about my illness with people who I trust.</strong> Because of this, I have formed the strength which has kept me going. Speaking out saved my life, and if you’re reading this and you feel alone because of your pain, <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> I encourage you to do the same.</strong> <i> I had momentary irrational thoughts of unleashing complete chaos by sharing my suffering, but they were quickly outweighed by the feeling of receptive love and compassion I experienced after I opened up.</i></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-blue"> The irrefutable fact is this: people care about you. </strong>It may be a complete stranger or it may be your best friend, but they care.<strong>on what you have complete control over: your choice to speak out and share your story. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-light"></strong>Today I have my anxiety (my gremlins) under control. Build a support system and your recovery will be on the right path, and your daily struggles will become that much more manageable. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> Remember this: pain is real but hope is real too. It’s up to you to choose which you believe in most. </strong></p>

  <h2> L.A.'s Story </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-blue">My descent into GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) began the morning I received the call bringing the news of my mother’s accidental death.</strong> <strong class="text-effra-light">It was the same week that my husband was laid off. We had moved across the country for his new job, and eight months later he was laid off. </strong> <i class="text-effra-regular">After only two months out West, we moved back, and I had a nervous breakdown. </i></p>
  <p> The move back East did not cure my anxiety, but when I was put on an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) three months later, I made a quick and complete turnaround. I thought I was home free.<strong class="text-effra-regular"> But the following year my 17-year marriage fell apart, and my husband moved out. </strong> <strong>stayed on my medication and landed on my feet. I did so well I eventually decided to taper off my medicine.</strong> </p>
  <p> Four months later, I signed my final divorce papers, had to put my 13-year-old dog to sleep, and had a medical scare with a frightening test procedure all in the same week. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue">And I redeveloped GAD very fast.</strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> It was worse this time, and going back on the medicine did not provide the same rapid cure.</strong></p>
  <p> After three months of utter misery and many different combinations of medications, I tried to end my pain with an overdose. Two weeks after that, I made a violent suicide attempt.<i class="text-effra-light"> I ended up in the hospital: ICU for three weeks and the psychiatric ward for three more. </i> When I was released, I weighed 93 pounds on my 5’7” frame.</p>
  <p> While I was in a haze of morphine and pneumonia, the doctors had stabilized me once again on my original medication and dose.<strong class="text-effra-bold-blue">When I came to, I was no longer anxious. </strong> <strong>But I was overwhelmed by the tasks before me: reclaiming my health, repairing my relationships, regaining my family’s trust.It was a long process with many setbacks.</strong> <strong class="text-effra-regular">But as I worked with a counselor and psychiatrist and slowly began to recoup my strength, I became very determined to “get my life back,” as I wrote in my journal.</strong></p>
  <p><strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue">With the help of health professionals and my family and friends, as well as staying on my medication, I not only got my life back, I gained a second career as an advocate for the mentally ill.</strong> I now work full time, raise my son, own my own home, and volunteer as an “In Our Own Voice” presenter for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).<i class="text-effra-bold">At one presentation, I was honored to thank personally the two paramedics who saved my life on the day of my suicide attempt. They didn’t know that I had lived.</i> </p>
  <p> I have also written a book chronicling my illness and recovery and what I have learned about mental disorders. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue">aim now is to give those suffering from anxiety hope and to prevent them from doing what I did. I firmly believe that if I can feel better, anyone can. </strong></p>
