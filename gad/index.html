<div class="article"> 
  <h2> What it means </h2>
  <p> Generalized anxiety disorder (or GAD) <strong class ="text-effra-regular"> is marked by excessive, exaggerated anxiety and worry about everyday life events for no obvious reason.</strong> People with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder tend to always expect disaster  <strong class ="text-effra-regular-blue"> and can't stop worrying about health, money, family, work, or school. </strong> </p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light"> Everyone feels anxiety now and then </i> - and there can be good reasons why. <strong class="text-effra-regular-blue"> But in people with GAD, the worry is often unrealistic or out of proportion for the situation. </strong> Daily life becomes a constant state of worry, fear, and dread. <strong class="text-effra-bold">Eventually, anxiety can even dominate a person's thinking so much </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">that they find it hard to do routine things at work or school, socially, and in their relationships.</i>  But there are treatments to ease anxiety so it’s not running your life. <strong class="text-effra-regular"> Nearly 4 million adult Americans, or about 2%, have GAD during the course of a year. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-blue"> It most often begins in childhood or adolescence but can begin in adulthood. It is more common in women than in men.</strong></p>

  <h3> Causes </h3>
  <p> Experts don’t know the exact causes of generalized anxiety disorder. <strong class="text-effra-bold-blue"> Several things </strong> - <i> including genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental stresses </i> - <strong class="text-effra-bold"> appear to contribute to its development. </strong> Some research suggests that family history plays a part in making it more likely that a person will have GAD. <strong class="text-effra-bold-blue">This means that the tendency to develop GAD may be passed on in families.</strong> But no anxiety genes have been identified, and families may also pass down the tendency through lifestyle or environment. <strong class="text-effra-bold-blue">GAD has been linked to problems with certain nerve cell pathways that connect particular brain regions involved in thinking and emotion. </strong> </p> 
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light">These nerve cell connections depend on chemicals called neurotransmitters that send information from one nerve cell to the next. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-blue"> If the pathways that connect particular brain regions don’t work well, problems related to mood or anxiety may result.</strong> <i class="text-effra-light"> Medicines, psychotherapies, or other treatments that are thought to work on these neurotransmitters may improve the signaling between circuits and help to improve symptoms related to anxiety or depression.</i> </p>

  <h3> Symptoms </h3>
  <p> <strong class ="text-effra-bold"> GAD affects the way a person thinks, and it can lead to physical symptoms. </strong> Mental health professionals use a standard set of criteria to diagnose GAD. <strong> Those symptoms can’t be caused by a medical problem or other condition and last at least 6 months. </strong>

  <ul> 
    <li> Excessive, ongoing worry and tension</li>
    <li> <strong> Unrealistic view of problems </strong> </li>
    <li> <strong class ="text-effra-bold"> Restlessness or a feeling of being "edgy" </strong></li>
    <li> Trouble concentrating</li>
    <li> <i> Tiring easily or being fatigued</i></li>
    <li> <strong class ="text-effra-regular">Increased crankiness or irritability</strong></li>
    <li> <strong> Trouble sleeping</strong> </li>
    <li> Muscle tension or muscle aches and soreness</li>
