  <h2> What it means </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold-green">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health problem. It can affect people of all ages.</strong> A child with PTSD keeps having scary thoughts and memories of a past event. He or she find the event terrifying, either physically or emotionally. <strong> The symptoms of PTSD may start soon after a stressful event. Or they may not happen for 6 months or longer. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">Some children with PTSD have long-term effects. They may feel emotionally numb for a very long time. PTSD in children often becomes a long-term (chronic) problem.</i></p>
  
  <h3> Causes </h3>
  <p> Experts don’t know the exact causes of generalized anxiety disorder. <strong class="text-effra-bold">Several things - including genetics, brain chemistry, and environmental stresses - appear to contribute to its development.</strong>
    <p> <i> Some research suggests that family history plays a part in making it more likely that a person will have GAD. </i> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-green"> This means that the tendency to develop GAD may be passed on in families. But no anxiety genes have been identified, and families may also pass down the tendency through lifestyle or environment. </strong>
    <p>  GAD has been linked to problems with certain nerve cell pathways that connect particular brain regions involved in thinking and emotion. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> These nerve cell connections depend on chemicals called neurotransmitters that send information from one nerve cell to the next. </strong>If the pathways that connect particular brain regions don’t work well, problems related to mood or anxiety may result. <strong class="text-effra-bold-green">Medicines, psychotherapies, or other treatments that are thought to work on these neurotransmitters may improve the signaling between circuits and help to improve symptoms related to anxiety or depression.</strong>

  <h3> Symptoms </h3> 
  <p> Children and teens with PTSD feel a lot of emotional and physical distress when exposed to situations that remind them of the traumatic event.<strong class="text-effra-light"> Some may relive the trauma over and over again. They may have nightmares and disturbing memories during the day.</strong> </p>
  <p> They may also: </p>

  <ul> 
    <li> <strong> Have problems sleeping </strong></li>
    <li> Feel depressed or grouchy </li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Feel nervous or alert and watchful (on guard)</strong> </li>
    <li> <i>Lose interest in things they used to enjoy. They may seem detached or numb and are not responsive. </i></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-regular">Have trouble feeling affectionate </strong></li>
    <li> <strong> Be more aggressive than before, even violent</strong> </li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-light">Stay away from certain places or situations that bring back memories </strong></li>
    <li> <i class="text-effra-bold">Lose touch with reality </i></li>
    <li> Reenact an event for seconds or hours or, in rare cases, days </li>
    <li> <i> Worry about dying at a young age </i></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-light">Act younger than their age, such as thumb-sucking or bedwetting </strong></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Have physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches </strong></li>
    <li> <i> Have upsetting thoughts of the trauma </i></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-regular">Have bad dream or sleep problems </strong></li>
    <li> <strong> Have bad memories, called flashbacks, that make it seem like the trauma is still happening </strong></li>
    <li> <i class="text-effra-light">Not remember some parts of what happened </i></li>
  </ul>

  <h3> How can parents help? </h3>
  <ul> 
    <li> <i class="text-effra-bold">Help your child feel safe. They may need extra time, comfort, and care from you for a while. </i></li>
    <li> <strong> Help your child relax. Invite them to take a few slow breaths with you. Breathe in while you count to 3. Breathe out while you count to 5. </strong></li>
    <li> <i class="text-effra-regular">Do things together that you enjoy. Trauma can make it harder to feel the positive emotions that naturally help kids recharge. Play, laugh, enjoy nature, make music or art, cook. These activities can reduce stress and build your child’s resilience. </i></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-light">Reassure your child. Let them know they will get through this. And that you are there to help.</strong> </li>
    <li> <i>Let your child’s doctor know what your child has been through. Get a referral to a mental health professional (like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health counsellor who specializes in trauma therapy). </i></li>
    <li> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Tell your child’s teacher that your child went through a trauma. Kids with PTSD may have more trouble focusing on schoolwork. Ask for your child to have extra help or more time to do schoolwork if they need it for a while. </strong></li>
  </ul>
