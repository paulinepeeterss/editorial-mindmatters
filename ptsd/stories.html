  <h2> T.L.'s Story </h2>
  <h4> “You can’t forget the past, but you can change how you view it." </h4>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-regular-green"> For a significant portion of my childhood, I was sexually abused by one of my older brothers.</i> <strong>in secrecy, I thought it was a normal part of growing up. </strong>In year 5, the concept of sexual intercourse and conduct was brought to my attention, as well as with whom I could share this experience with. Given that I was 10 years old at the time, you can imagine the confusion that came with this newfound information. I was unable to process the magnitude of the situation and its long term consequences.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> It wasn’t until my early years at university that I began to come to terms with the impact that sexual abuse had on my life. </strong> <i> I was hypersensitive to touch, refused physical contact such as hugs, and had high anxiety among a number of other difficulties. </i> What confused me most was the terminology and connotations that came with ‘abuse’. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-green"> ‘Abuse’ to me implied a sense of experienced negativity and upon reflection of my memories, my experiences as a child were both physically arousing and at times emotionally distressing.</strong> Not all my experiences were traumatic and forced, some were coerced and others initiated by me.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold">The disparity between my feelings and what others told me was morally wrong confused me immensely. It was a major component that drove me to latch onto what made most sense - blaming someone. </strong>I had little knowledge of what ‘grooming’ was, and so placed the blame inwardly. </p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-regular-green">I was unable to tell anyone because I feared for my life. I was unable to communicate effectively because I had been unknowing for so long.</i> I was unable to freely express my thoughts because I feared rejection and a lack of support. <strong> The items in these sentences are “I” which implies a sense of personal responsibility. These thoughts over time became the norm, and it became how I learned to deal with what I felt and how I was ‘supposed’ to feel according to the norms of sexual abuse. </strong> I rationalised this blame inwardly because I felt it was my responsibility to ensure my own safety and sexual development. Worse still, I could have spoken out at any time, but chose not to.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular-green">This blame game led to an internal fight accompanied by self-deprecating thoughts, immense feelings of shame since I was unable to speak out, and an unrealistically high standard of emotional control. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">A deep depression followed that severely affected my emotional stability, and ability to study and work.</i></p>
  <p> Noticing my failing grades, the academic progress committee at my University decided to monitor me. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> They offered counselling sessions, consultations with doctors and psychiatrists and a support network with specialised services, such as the Centre Against Sexual Abuse (CASA), that I wasn’t aware was out there. </strong> After countless counselling sessions, meditation and prescribed medication from my doctor, I was able to get my depression under control.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-green">What I wanted to highlight here is how I learned to view the traumatic event. A change in perspective really can do wonders in coming to terms with and understanding the emotions that came with the trauma. </strong> I put my traumatic event under a microscope and questioned the blame I placed on myself: <i class="text-effra-light">what if it were another child who had gone through the same experience? How would I feel towards them? What if they came to me, confused about how they felt? Would I deny them of support, empathy, or understanding? </i></p>
  <p> The obvious answer is ‘hell no’. I would go to the ends of the earth to ensure their safety, protection and happiness. But because I did not receive this kind of support as a child, the idea was so foreign. I had to learn that what happened to me was extremely unfortunate, <strong> but what I could do was control my reaction to it. And I’ve chosen to react in a pro-active way by not allowing it to be the defining factor of who I am; </strong> <i class="text-effra-regular-green">by raising awareness of the situation, by making it a less ‘taboo’ topic, by making sure this doesn’t happen to those around me, and hopefully - to all children. My experiences were traumatic, my pain is real, but the motivation that comes from it is pure, compassionate and kind. </i></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Understanding myself more now, I extend the compassion I would for a child who has gone through the same experience towards myself. </strong> I rationalize it this way because I cannot blame children for their lack of understanding, so how can I blame myself? They’re children - underdeveloped cognitively, emotionally, physically and psychologically. They are unable to understand fully, sexual conduct and the consequences of actions, making them sensitive to manipulation and coercion. With that said,<strong class="text-jubilat-bold-green"> children should be protected and free to explore their sexuality in an environment that is safe and loving. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold">I now extend this empathy inwardly - for if I choose to deny myself of such compassion, then I’m indirectly denying sufferers from that same understanding and support.</strong></p>
  <p> I plucked up the courage to write a letter to my parents, sent it off, and awaited their reply. Long story short - <i class="text-effra-light">I cried, they cried, asked me why I never told them, they told me they always had an idea but thought I would speak up about it - and much to my surprise, the walls that always kept my emotions in check began to dissolve. </i> This feeling of unexpected support and understanding was beyond anything I could have imagined (I’m crying just writing about it now!), and the weight that held me down was slowly lifted.<strong class="text-effra-bold-green"></i> I could feel happiness without it being tainted by my past memories, I could study without having flashbacks, and I could connect with others on a much more personal level. </strong> <strong> And the sense of clarity that came with this acknowledgement and release of pain was more than welcomed.</strong></p>

  <h2> Kizzy’s Story</h2>
  <p> I came from a middle class family which for all intents and purposes looked normal - nicely kept house, participated in the community, took vacations ... <strong> However, things were not the same behind closed doors.</strong> <i class="text-effra-light"> You see my father was a (high functioning) alcoholic and tension and fear were pervasive in my family. </i> For the longest time I thought it was his addiction that was ground zero for my family's problems.  We walked on eggshells, trying to please, be quiet, reading the moods of my parents for any danger throughout childhood.<strong class="text-jubilat-regular-green"> Friday nights were the worst because my father would stumble home drunk, followed by silent but oh so palpable anger on my mother's part for the rest of the weekend. </strong> Wash, rinse, repeat, the cycle continued.</p>
  <p> In my twenties, plagued by depression and anxiety I sought the help of a therapist,. <strong> I also started attending an Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACOA) group.  Both helped me to understand what addiction does to a family, and that in mine I was the Scapegoat and Lost Child, my brother the Golden Child, and my mother the Enabler.</strong>  Even knowing this, however, I was still constantly anxious and depressed. <strong class="text-effra-regular-green"> Eventually I was diagnosed with chronic depression and prescribed Prozac which I stayed on for decades and saw therapists off and on. </strong> Not much shifted internally.<i class="text-effra-light"> I knew that my family was dysfunctional but inside I felt like I had endured something much more sinister and damaging, life threatening almost. Was I simply being too sensitive? </i>I had these times when I felt like the very ground beneath my feet tilted sideways, and I was caught in a whirling vortex of anxiety and fear.  Was I going crazy? </p>
  <p> I survived for almost three decades with the strong side showing outwardly, and the fractured, frightened side hidden until in 2013 a number of things happened that led me to look for those missing pieces in earnest.<strong> I was in my fifties by then and my symptoms had worsened in part due to menopause, but other stresses as well including a battle against Ovarian Cancer, my child heading off to university, and the death of my father.</strong> I knew (hoped?) there had to be more to my story after decades of therapy and being on an SSRI and still feeling this frightening something I could not name or see/feel clearly.</p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-bold-green">I found my way to Out of the Fog where I learned that in addition to addiction, my family suffers from covert Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</i> It took a while to see this covert NPD behaviour as abusive, but when the light went on finally it was truly a eureka moment.<strong> I finally understood just how crazy and soul crushing life had been in childhood, that I been emotionally abused and neglected. </strong> The core wound in Complex PTSD is to the spirit and soul of the abused, it is ongoing, interpersonal traumatization by the abuser.  In some cases it is overt (physical/sexual abuse), and other times it is more subtle or covert as it was in my family, but in the end it all represents constant trauma with no hope of escape.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold-green"> So Complex PTSD was the reason I was still struggling in life. I finally felt like I had all the pieces which was a relief, but at the same time it was overwhelmingly frightening and represented the loss of hope.</strong> I had to understand and accept that my family would never love me in the way I needed and deserved, that they were forever broken and I must move on. <i class="text-effra-light"> There was much grief and anger in my life then. And shortly after being diagnosed my husband and I bought a retirement home in a small rural town and I moved there alone. </i> My son was at university and my husband had stayed behind to finish out his contract which still had nine months. <strong class="text-effra-regular-green">As such, I did not have any support in place when the revelations of abuse and having Complex PTSD came about.</strong></p>
  <p> <i>I started to have panic attacks (which I now know were emotional flashbacks), and was so depressed I could not get out of bed on many days. By the end I was drinking all day and hiding in the closet trying to block out any light and sound.</i> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-green"></i>Crazy stuff but that’s full blown Complex PTSD for you. My husband had to finish up his employment a month early and fly home.  I had fallen apart.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong>I stopped drinking the day he arrived -- cold turkey (very bad idea - there is medical help to do it without risk of seizures and the like) and together we went to my GP.</strong> I told her all that was going on and what a humbling experience that was for someone who rarely asked for any help from anyone and was independent and strong (on the outside at least). <strong class="text-effra-light-green"> After a few tries getting on the right medication I ended up on Celexa which fortunately did wonders for me, bringing my anxiety attacks and depression down in fairly short order. </strong>I had spent two decades on Prozac and within a few weeks of starting this medication I began to feel comfortable in my skin for the first time.  I also began seeing a psychiatrist and an addictions counselor. </p>
  <p> <i>Over time between the medication, therapy, and being at OOTF and then here at OOTS I found my way out of the raging storm that was my inner life. </i> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> I have far fewer and less intense EFs, the depression has lifted bit by bit, I know what triggers me and how to manage/avoid these things, I dissociate less and less, my Inner Child (and other parts) are more integrated, and overall I feel like I have more inner space for the positive things in life.</strong></p>
  <p> I used to think that I would heal completely, but now I understand that the trauma is part of me and I will always have to manage it.<strong class="text-jubilat-bold-green">By processing it as much as I can rather than hiding from it though I am in the driver’s seat now. Life is good and getting better.</strong></p>
