  <h2> A mother's Story </h2>
  <p> B.R. considers herself lucky. She is a mother of three adult children; her oldest and youngest children—a son S.T. and a daughter D.T., respectively—both struggled with depression.<strong class="text-effra-bold-red"> They both attended talk therapy and both took medication, but—and this why B.R. uses the word “lucky”—neither child was hospitalized and neither one ever had suicidal thoughts or plans.</strong> </p>
  <p> B.R. remembers that her son, S.T., was a happy, cheery child.<i class="text-effra-bold"> When he was in second grade there was a noticeable change in his demeanor: he was a bit sadder and more withdrawn.</i> <strong class="text-effra-light"> So, B.R. pulled out her parenting books which told her that this kind of change was normal for kids her son’s age and that the mood changes would pass naturally. </strong>When S.T. was in high school, one of his friends died by suicide; this tragedy was a catalyst for B.R. bringing to her son the possibility of therapy as a way to process the death and to work through the depression B.R. suspected was also plaguing him.<strong class="text-jubilat-bold-red"> B.R. says she felt something was off when S.T. began to lose interest in activities he had once loved and was no longer working up to his potential in school.</strong> </p>
  <p> <i> A few years later when B.R.’s daughter began to exhibit symptoms of depression, B.R. was much more well-informed and knew how to get help more quickly.</i> During the spring of D.T.’s junior year of high school, B.R. and her husband noticed changes in her mood and extreme weight loss.<strong class="text-effra-bold-red"> D.T.—who was usually affectionate and happy—was crabby and snapping at her parents.</strong> <i class="text-effra-light-red"> Her daughter was also experiencing these changes around the same time that another young adult died by suicide, which, again, provided an opportunity to bring up the possibility of treatment. </i>For both S.T. and D.T., it was a mother’s intuition that helped B.R. notice that something was happening with her children beyond growing pains or bad moods.</p>
  <p> B.R. found therapists for both her son and daughter by first talking to their primary care physician who was able to make referrals.<strong>The therapist’s personality-fit with her child and willingness to set and communicate specific therapy goals were of the utmost importance.</strong><strong class="text-effra-bold"> B.R.’s feeling has always been that her children should feel comfortable talking to their therapists without the worry that information might be shared with her and without their consent.</strong> Instead, B.R. worked to keep communication open by asking her children how they thought therapy was going and whether or not it was helpful.<i class="text-effra-bold-red"> She never asked for specifics about her children’s therapy sessions because she didn’t want to push her children to share anything that they didn’t choose to share willingly.</i> The biggest indicator of success was watching her children return to their pre-depression levels of happiness and activity.</p>
  <p><strong class="text-effra-light"> B.R. still feels guilty that by not noticing and intervening with her son’s depression earlier on, S.T. suffered through depression without having a name for it for so long. B.R. recalls that looking back on her childhood that her father most likely had depression, though it was something which was not discussed or addressed at all.</strong> B.R., as well, remembers a depressive episode of her own when she was in college; however, when she sought the advice of a school psychiatrist, she was told that she didn’t need therapy.<i class="text-jubilat-bold-red"> In retrospect, B.R. thinks it would have been helpful to have talked to someone, but luckily the episode of depression passed on its own.</i> As a parent, B.R. says, you never want your children to feel anything but happy, though this cannot always be the case. <i class="text-effra-light"> There is some guilt and distress over knowing that the same depression you recognized in yourself and your family members is showing up for your children.</i><strong>It is hard to watch your child struggle.</strong></p>
  <p> The best way to set your children up for success whenever they encounter mental illness, B.R. says, <strong class="text-effra-bold-red">  is to create a safe, open family environment where your children trust that no matter their age their parents will be there to help them should any sort of struggle recur. </strong> <strong> advises that you cannot live your life as if depression is right around the corner; instead, you should be introspective about why you are feeling the things you are and take action for yourself and your loved ones. </strong> That way, if the depression returns, you are ready to handle it and have people around you who know how to support you.</p>

  <h2> Neil's Story </h2>
  <p> <i> I had recently lost my best friend, one of the most trusted people of my life. </i> <strong class="text-effra-bold-red"> I was in need of a support. Everything was new to me. </strong> And eventually, I made a huge blunder in choosing friends, probably the biggest mistake of my life. They misused my innocence and love what I had for them as persons and exposed me to addictions.<strong class="text-effra-bold">  Thankfully I wasn't taken into it. One of them became a very close friend of mine just to come close to and eventually  propose a girl who was my close friend. </strong> <strong> Again I was used. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light"> All of this distraction led my grades to detoriate. And all of a sudden I lost my maternal grandma, who was my very first inspiration.</i> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-red"> These heartbreaks and trust issues led me into Depression until a guy came to my rescue.</strong> He pushed me forward in every way he could. And helped me secure 92% in IX. But I didn't recover completely. I wasn't emotionally stable at all. Then another guy joined the school and unknowingly became very close. I was inspired by him.<strong> I saw a different perception of life. His personality was very like my grandma's. And without the knowledge of both me and himself, he made me emotionally strong and taught me self worth and confidence, which I lacked during that phase.</strong> These two guys played a huge role in my recovery and because of them I'm alive.<i class="text-effra-light"> There were times when I thought of jumping off the terrace of our 8 storeyed building, cutting my veins,etc.</i><strong class="text-effra-bold">But Everytime I was stopped by the visuals of my mom, my grandma, and them. The second guy insisted me to continue with my sports and music, which I had almost left during the phase </strong>( I'm a state level Badminton player and swimmer and I'm classically trained in vocal and sitar). Yes indeed. Coming back into sports helped me a lot recovering.<strong class="text-jubilat-bold-red">  The key point to fight depression is to accept. Confidence automatically vanishes. But acceptance makes the task easier to get it back and right.</strong></p>

  <h2> Pornima's Story </h2>
  <p> Being a daughter of a School van driver; I grew up in Mumbai chawl in a traditional middle-class family. <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-red">I was told to choose an educational path because it gives the financial stability in our Indian culture. </strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light"> When I was 12th Std, I didn't get enough career guidance. When my board result got declared, there were inquiries about my careers from home.</i> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> Initially, I was not studying for CET (Medical/ Engineering entrance) at all; because all I wanted to score good in 12th exam.</strong> Because of it I fell short & scored less in the CET exam which I had given only for the namesake. I did not get admission for Med. / Engg. in any college on these marks.<strong> In this situation I dropped a year and I became clueless to the questions of my career that fell on me.</strong></p>
  <p> Many of my classmates who got 50% marks were also studying in some or the other college.<strong class="text-jubilat-bold-red"> Having been at home for almost a year I went into depression, I had to hear from my relatives that a year has been wasted, then how will it happen next, will the wedding of a girl take place on time, etc. </strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light"> Meanwhile I met a friend who was doing Architecture in JJ School of Art. In fact, painting has been my favorite subject since childhood, but I never thought about making a career out of it.</i> <strong class="text-effra-bold">I always wanted to put a degree next to my name and after meeting her, I realized that architecture can be a career option.</strong> I believe, when we get options we are often confused. Due to our financial situation, we had no option/choice than getting admission in a government college. I prepared well for the exam & got good marks too. In 2017, I got admission in the prestigious Rachna Sansad’s Academy of Architecture, Mumbai.</p>
  <p><i class="text-effra-light-red">I could be the woman who has fear, who don’t have her opinions, who was quite & shy inside, but I realize my potential to do, to be or to achieve anything that I want & wanted the world would see it.</i><strong class="text-jubilat-bold-red"> Today, I am not only an Architect; but a Miss India, Model, TEDX Speaker & but being independent & confident has always been my dream! </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Growing up & transform my life into a meaningful turn is what I learned from depression.</strong> </p>
