  <h2> Sara's Story </h2>
  <p> My story is not that different from most people with an eating disorder. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple"> My struggle with bulimia fits the textbook definition and the similarities between my story and others are uncanny.</strong> But to me, it is unique, it is different and it is extremely personal. And my recent journey into recovery has been the proudest, most difficult accomplishment of my life.<strong class="text-effra-light">I am currently 25 years old and I have had issues with my weight and my self-esteem since junior high. I was your typical, awkward preteen. Chubby, braces, glasses, acne and a sweet, yet painfully shy, personality. I was self-conscious about everything, including my weight. </strong></p>
  <p> <i> As I entered high school, the concern I had about my body grew stronger. Then one day, I was home after school watching a talk show.</i> <strong class="text-effra-regular-purple"> The topic was eating disorders. I watched several young girls discuss their struggles with anorexia and/or bulimia. </strong>I listened intently as one girl described exactly how she made herself sick. A light went off in my head. I made my way to the washroom in a daze. I looked at myself in the mirror, still not entirely sure what I was doing.  Then I pulled my hair back into a ponytail, knelt over the toilet and made myself sick. <strong> I wish, with all my heart, that I could tell every young girl or boy who is contemplating that very action for the first time (or the action of skipping a meal) – not to succumb. That it may seem like a great way to control your weight, but instead it wreaks havoc on your body.That you may think you’ll only do it once in a while, but like any addiction it will become your life. I wish I could tell them to say NO to that first, not so powerful, urge. To get out while they still can.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> My on again, off again relationship with bulimia throughout high school and university was not something I considered serious – at the time. It was my coping mechanism something I could fall back on when I was feeling fat, stressed or upset. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light"> I would go for weeks without making myself sick, the pattern was incredibly sporadic. I was in complete control of my bulimia. When I was 22 – bulimia gained control over me. I had just graduated from university. </i> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> Society was expecting me to ‘go out and get a job’. Along with a job, I was supposed to get an income, a place to live and to support myself completely independently for the first time in my life. </strong> I was terrified. <strong> At this very time I was busy feeling rejected and worthless. A serious boyfriend had dumped me, for the second time in my life. It was not a great phase for me. I sank into a very depressive-like state. </strong> <i class="text-effra-bold-purple"> I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep and I spent my time either crying or listing reasons why I shouldn’t exist. As a result I began to lose weight. I didn’t even realize at first that I was getting smaller. </i> My friends and family did. Everyone kept telling me how great I looked, but I couldn’t see it. It wasn’t until I was at work one weekend that I finally realized something was going on. <strong class="text-effra-light">My weekend job involved respite care for four elderly ladies. I was in the kitchen baking cookies for them, when one walked in and asked if I had lost weight. A question I had grown accustomed to hearing, but never from a person with dementia.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple"> Once I realized how much weight I had lost – I also realized I could never gain it back. When I had been heavier, I had been deemed ‘unlovable’. </strong>I had so many overwhelming feelings at this time in my life, and no idea what to do with them. <i class="text-effra-regular">Bingeing and purging was a temporary release for me, although I realize now that each bulimic episode was only intensifying my feelings. </i>I continued spiralling downwards, constantly finding new methods of self-torture. I often scared myself with the intensity of my abusive actions. <strong> I consider myself a very loving, caring person and would never inflict harm on anyone. But I was certainly capable of inflicting harm on myself.</strong> I reflect back to this time as a very painful, lonely period in my life. I had no ability to look toward the future; all I knew was that this ‘behaviour’ was my life. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple">This began to change during one very remarkable weekend. Two important things happened that weekend.</strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-regular"> One was that my mother stumbled across my ‘secret’. The second was that I met someone. That someone turned out to be my rock. He has been so supportive and affirmative throughout my entire journey. </i> After several heart wrenching talks with my parents, sister and then-boyfriend (he is now my fiancée); I began a roller coaster of a journey. <strong class="text-effra-bold">I explored several therapists and support groups before finding a good fit. I worked with an amazing dietician who helped me to rediscover the importance of food. I had intense sessions with a counsellor who assisted me in confronting my issues. I went up, I went down. </strong>I had days when I felt on top of the world. I felt in control, healthy and happy. I also had days where I hit rock bottom.</p>
  <h4> “I would scream at myself in the mirror not to succumb to the urge, and end up in a puddle of tears on the bathroom floor. ”</h4>
  <p> I continued on this path, but each time I caught a glimpse of recovery I would grow slightly stronger. And ever so gradually the time period between relapses would increase. Last fall, I had an opportunity to make a big life change. <strong class="text-effra-light">I left the hectic, rush of a big city to move to the small town where my fiancée lived. I accepted a job that allowed me to work four days a week. </strong>I began to make time for myself. I learned the importance of self-care and began to let go of self-abuse. And since we were finally together, my fiancée and I did something we’d always talked about. After a generous Christmas present from my father – we went to the local SPCA and adopted a cat. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple">I will never underestimate the value of pet therapy. Today I am entering my fourth month of recovery. </strong> To some, that may not sound like a big deal. To me it is my greatest accomplishment. It is the longest stretch I have ever had. And though I still have far to go, this is the first time I have ever felt hope. Hope that my life will continue this way.</p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> I have learned so much from my battle with bulimia. I have learned about my own personal strength, which is more phenomenal than I ever would have realized.</strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-purple">I have also learned the importance of a healthy lifestyle. These days I eat nutritional, well-balanced meals and incorporate healthy exercise into my day. And I enjoy this. </strong> I enjoy taking care of myself and living my life. I have also realized that the people in my life are more supportive and understanding than I could have ever known. My family, close friends and fiancée were by my side through each phase of the journey – never once casting judgement or anger my way.<strong class="text-effra-bold-purple"> The most important thing I have learned is to appreciate myself as a person, not as how I look. My mother’s catch phrase ‘beauty comes from the inside’ does not fall on deaf ears anymore. </strong> I no longer measure my self-worth with a scale or tape measure. I feel beautiful because of who I am, how I treat others, and most importantly how I treat myself.</p>
  <p> Beauty is not a pimple-free face, or a tiny waist, or shiny hair, or any other airbrushed quality we witness daily in the media. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple"> It is who you are on the inside. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-regular">And though I am proud of discovering who I am through my struggle, my greatest hope is that others will never have to work through an eating disorder to discover who they are.</strong></p>

  <h2> Sophie's Story </h2>
  <p> Sophie was 14 when she became bulimic. Different things changed in her life and the pressure got too much. <strong class="text-effra-regular-purple"> She's now 20 and has recovered from bulimia. She hopes her story will encourage others to ask for help. </strong> <i> "I started trying to lose weight when a lot of things became uncertain in my life. My two best friends moved to a private school. This made me feel really separate from them. Their family had more money and it felt to me like they were special – I couldn't compare to them."</i></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light"> "My Grampa died around this time, which triggered lots of uncomfortable feelings as I lost my father when I was five. During this time I found comfort in eating. It was safe and familiar. Eating helped me forget how unhappy I felt at the time."</strong></p>
  <p> <strong> "When I gained weight over summer I was shocked. I couldn't be 'the fat one' - I was already shy, relatively poor compared to my friends, and had lost my dad. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-regular-purple">I came back to school and was determined to lose weight. This was something I could do without money, something I could do to make myself 'better' when I felt so worthless. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold">I gradually began to lose weight by making myself eat less food and exercising too much. I lost a lot of weight but I didn't feel like I had achieved anything.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple">"I became obsessed with my body image. The more depressed I was, the more I hated my body. </strong> I can't remember the first time I properly binged and purged by throwing up, but suddenly it became a way of keeping my body weight the same. </p>
  <p> "I tried to keep losing weight but again life was becoming more challenging. I felt a lot of pressure at school. I also put pressure on myself to achieve and to be the best. <strong class="text-effra-regular">I became obsessed with my body image. The more depressed I was, the more I hated my body. I can't remember the first time I properly binged and purged by throwing up, but suddenly it became a way of keeping my body weight the same.</strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light-purple">"This binge/purge cycle went on for several years, and it became too much to deal with when I got to college. </i> I was throwing up sometimes five times a day and I was bingeing before the day had even started. I dropped out due to stress/exhaustion combined with depression.</p>
  <p> <strong> "I finally decided I wanted to get better, and put my life into perspective when I began treatment. At the start of my eating disorder I was referred to a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist (CBT) through my doctor. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-light">At first I used it as a way of keeping my mum happy, because I didn't want to recover. I only wanted to be thinner.</strong></p>
  <p> <i>"When the depression began to take over my life, I decided I really needed to get better – for the sake of my family and my future. More than anything, I wanted to get better.</i></p>
  <p> <strong> "I went back to my GP and was referred to a different therapist who helped me talk through my problems a lot more – I really clicked with her and what she suggested actually made sense to me. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-purple">I think it's important to find someone to talk to who you trust. Sometimes that isn't the first therapist or counsellor you're referred to. </strong> I still use some of the techniques she taught me to deal with things I find challenging. </p>
  <p> "It wasn't straightforward, and I didn't magically un-muddle my thoughts, wake up one day and stop eating/purging. <strong> It took time and lots of patience but it paid off. I don't let food or my body image dictate my life anymore.</strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-bold-purple">"I wrote my feelings down and tried to make sense of them that way – I think people with eating disorders need an outlet to deal with their emotions.</i></p>
  <p> "I always used to feel like I was one of the people who wouldn't recover. I thought I'd be stuck in that cycle forever – and it made me extremely miserable and frustrated. I was the only person ever in the way of my own recovery. <strong>Once I opened my mind and realised there was so much more to life than being thin and pretty, I became so much happier.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light">"I am thankful that I found the courage to ask for help – I really needed it, as do so many other people. Now I want to tell people what I went through to stop it happening to so many other people. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple"> Mental illness is not a life sentence - you are not destined to be 'bulimic' or 'anorexic' or a 'binge-eater'. Your life is in your hands."</strong></p>
