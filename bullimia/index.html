<div class= "article"> 
  <h2> What it means </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular">Bulimia nervosa is another well-known eating disorder. Like anorexia, bulimia tends to develop during adolescence and early adulthood and appears to be less common among men than women. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-purple">People with bulimia frequently eat unusually large amounts of food in a specific period of time.</strong> Each binge eating episode usually continues until the person becomes painfully full. <strong> During a binge, the person usually feels that they cannot stop eating or control how much they are eating. </strong></p> 
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light">Binges can happen with any type of food but most commonly occur with foods the individual would normally avoid. </strong>Individuals with bulimia then attempt to purge to compensate for the calories consumed and relieve gut discomfort.  <i class="text-effra-bold"> Common purging behaviors include forced vomiting, fasting, laxatives, diuretics, enemas, and excessive exercise. Symptoms may appear very similar to those of the binge eating or purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa.  </i>  <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-purple"> However, individuals with bulimia usually maintain a relatively normal weight, rather than becoming underweight.</strong>
  
<h3> Causes </h3>
  <p>  <strong class="text-effra-bold"> Experts believe that eating disorders may be caused by a variety of factors.One of these is genetics.</strong>  <i class="text-effra-light"> Twin and adoption studies involving twins who were separated at birth and adopted by different families provide some evidence that eating disorders may be hereditary. This type of research has generally shown that if one twin develops an eating disorder, the other has a 50% likelihood of developing one too, on average.</i>
    <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-purple"> Personality traits are another cause. In particular, neuroticism, perfectionism, and impulsivity are three personality traits often linked to a higher risk of developing an eating disorder.</strong>
    <strong> Other potential causes include perceived pressures to be thin, cultural preferences for thinness, and exposure to media promoting such ideals.</strong> </p>
    <p>  <strong class="text-effra-regular"> In fact, certain eating disorders appear to be mostly nonexistent in cultures that haven’t been exposed to Western ideals of thinness.</strong>
      <i class="text-effra-light-purple"> That said, culturally accepted ideals of thinness are very present in many areas of the world. Yet, in some countries, few individuals end up developing an eating disorder. </i>Thus, they are likely caused by a mix of factors. 
    More recently, experts have proposed that differences in brain structure and biology may also play a role in the development of eating disorders. <strong>In particular, levels of the brain messengers serotonin and dopamine may be factors. However, more studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made.</strong> </p>
