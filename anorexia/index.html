<div class= "article"> 
  <h2> What it means </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-pink"> Anorexia nervosa is likely the most well-known eating disorder. </strong> It generally develops during adolescence or young adulthood and tends to affect more women than men. <strong class="text-effra-bold"> People with anorexia generally view themselves as overweight, even if they’re dangerously underweight. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-light"> They tend to constantly monitor their weight, avoid eating certain types of foods, and severely restrict their calories.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Such individuals may also have difficulty eating in public and exhibit a strong desire to control their environment, limiting their ability to be spontaneous. </strong>Anorexia is officially categorized into two subtypes — the restricting type and the binge eating and purging type. Individuals with the restricting type lose weight solely through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercise. <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-pink"> Individuals with the binge eating and purging type may binge on large amounts of food or eat very little. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">In both cases, after they eat, they purge using activities like vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics, or exercising excessively. </i> <strong class="text-effra-bold-pink"> Anorexia can be very damaging to the body. </strong> Over time, individuals living with it may experience the thinning of their bones, infertility, brittle hair and nails, and the growth of a layer of fine hair all over their body. <strong> In severe cases, anorexia can result in heart, brain, or multi-organ failure and death. </strong></p>
  <h3> Causes </h3>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular-pink">Experts believe that eating disorders may be caused by a variety of factors. One of these is genetics.</strong> Twin and adoption studies involving twins who were separated at birth and adopted by different families provide some evidence that eating disorders may be hereditary. <strong> This type of research has generally shown that if one twin develops an eating disorder, the other has a 50% likelihood of developing one too, on average.</strong>
    <strong class="text-effra-light"> Personality traits are another cause. In particular, neuroticism, perfectionism, and impulsivity are three personality traits often linked to a higher risk of developing an eating disorder. </strong>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular-pink"> Other potential causes include perceived pressures to be thin, cultural preferences for thinness, and exposure to media promoting such ideals. </strong> <strong> In fact, certain eating disorders appear to be mostly nonexistent in cultures that haven’t been exposed to Western ideals of thinness.</strong>
  <i> That said, culturally accepted ideals of thinness are very present in many areas of the world. </i> <strong class="text-effra-light-pink"> Yet, in some countries, few individuals end up developing an eating disorder.  </strong></p>
  <p> Thus, they are likely caused by a mix of factors. More recently, experts have proposed that differences in brain structure and biology may also play a role in the development of eating disorders. <i class="text-effra-bold-pink">In particular, levels of the brain messengers serotonin and dopamine may be factors. </i> <strong>However, more studies are needed before strong conclusions can be made. </strong></p>
