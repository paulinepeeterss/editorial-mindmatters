  <h2> Jaclyn's Story </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-light-pink">As a 12-year-old with full-blown anorexia, I was involuntarily institutionalized after having an eating disorder–induced seizure. </strong> The institution was not equipped to deal with eating disorders, and their only plan of action was to watch me eat, shower, and sleep to ensure I didn’t throw up, exercise, or throw my food away. <strong>I was treated less as a medical patient and more like a criminal, unable to privately mourn the loss of my innocence and adolescence. </strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-regular">This was my first insight into how our health care system is unprepared to treat eating disorder survivors, a travesty compounded by society’s rigid physical ideals for women. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">Survivors could best be served by the development of new treatment options targeted at modifying harmful behaviors and by eroding patriarchal visions of the female body.</i> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-pink"> Instead, we are treated like social outliers who are shamed and told we have taken things too far. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold">Denying the existence of sexism is a historically convenient method of the ignorant, and to tell an eating disorder survivor that our plight is of self-creation is to validate the disproportionate and unrealistic physical expectations for women that have permeated every aspect of society. </strong></p>
  <p> I will never forget the first time I saw my own reflection without wanting to see less of it. <strong>It took years for me to regain control of my life and body, both of which deserved respect and love after having spent years as a battleground. </strong> <i>Sharing my story was the first step toward total recovery and remains my personal form of resistance. </i> <strong class="text-effra-regular-pink">By speaking out, we can reduce the shame and stigma associated with eating disorders and give courage to millions of survivors.</strong></p>

  <h2> Meg's Story </h2>
  <p> <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-pink">My story begins at age 4. I was extremely underweight for my height and age; </strong> however, my grandmother told I had “arms like ham” and was “getting chubby.” I spent my entire childhood surrounded by weight stigma — <i class="text-effra-light">whether it was from my grandmother constantly telling me to “go on a diet” or comparing my own body to my friends'.</i></p>  
  <p> At 12, I went on what I described as a “very strict diet.” I had no clue what anorexia was. I thought it was when someone literally never ate anything due to some underlying emotional problem, <strong> when, in reality, accordingly to my personal understanding and experience, it’s a disease that manifests in the mind; an utter fear of weight gain. It does not have a specific physical appearance. </strong> <strong class="text-effra-bold-pink">It does not pick particular races or genders. It just is.</strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-regular">My “diet” left me with a failing liver, a problematic heart, hair loss, and osteopenia. </i> <strong class="text-effra-light">I went into treatment for anorexia and fully came to terms with my disease, and began to believe that I did not choose this. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-pink">Anorexia was like a light switch that lived inside my brain, turned off for most of my life. The stigma surrounding my weight is what turned it on.</strong></p>
  <p> For me, I will never turn my anorexia off. It’s always going to be a struggle. I can, however, dim the lights. <strong> Now, at 16, I remain recovered without relapse. </strong> <i class="text-effra-light">Although every day I see girls in magazines and in person with tiny waists, I am fighting. I am alive. </i> <strong class="text-effra-bold"> I almost lost my life, and my life is much more important than my weight. Someday, I think I will 100% believe I am beautiful, and I will do that on my own terms, without the help of a boy or Instagram likes. </strong> Until then, I remain a 16-year-old girl still surrounded by weight stigma and <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-pink">slowly, but surely, learning to be comfortable with myself. </strong></p>

  <h2> K.F.'s Story </h2>
  <p> <i class="text-effra-light"> My eating disorder was a unicorn in shape. I was never terrified of certain foods. I never truly thought I was fat. </i> <strong class="text-effra-bold">While I didn’t use my mathematically inclined mind to count calories, I used it to balance an equation in my head: an equation of worth. </strong> <strong class="text-jubilat-regular-pink">Growing up, food was taken away when I was bad. In my mind, I equated it to not being worth food at all. </strong> I took that mind-set to college, with a bit of freedom, resulting in a streak of bingeing. Each episode left me with this feeling of worthlessness. <strong> One might say it contributed to my leaving college after a violent sexual assault campus police refused to do anything about left me feeling even more worthless.</strong></p>
  <p> <strong class="text-effra-bold-pink"> But I was worth the physical demands of the military. I was worth the possibility of dying. </strong>During my time in the Air Force, I was told repeatedly that I was nothing. Things I recited to myself for years were now coming out of the lips of those in charge of me.<i> If there was any doubt I didn’t deserve to be alive, let alone eat, it was eradicated. </i> <strong class="text-effra-regular"> Ultimately, I was kicked out for having an eating disorder, deemed unable to deploy and unfit for service. As a parting gift, the military paid for my first treatment stint. </strong></p>
  <p> <i class="text-jubilat-bold">A couple of years passed before I needed treatment again, this time due to a severe heart problem from malnourishment. </i> <strong class="text-effra-light-pink"> I have never been so humbled and humiliated as those days I had to go into work with a feeding tube. </strong> I think I needed that. I couldn’t hide the fact I had an eating disorder by lying or saying I had a fast metabolism. I had something sticking out of my nose that couldn’t be ignored. <strong>After six months in treatment and the best psychiatrist I have ever had, I have been weight restored and behavior-free for two years. I have found balance. </strong> <i class="text-effra-regular">I have found that you assign your own worth. By assigning your own worth, you afford and deny yourself opportunities. </i> So set that worth high. Happiness is not a destination, it’s moments. <strong class="text-jubilat-bold-pink"> You won’t get moments of happiness if you feel worthless, because you won’t believe you deserve them. I want you to know: You deserve them. </strong></p>
