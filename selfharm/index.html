  <h2> What it means </h2>
  <p> Self-harm is when someone hurts themselves on purpose as a way of trying to manage distressing or overwhelming feelings and experiences.<strong class= "text-effra-regular-orange"> Someone who is self-harming might be dealing with lots of intense thoughts and feelings, and hurting themselves may feel like the only way to cope.</strong> <strong class= "text-effra-light">Or, they might feel numb and hurt themselves in order to feel something. If your child is self-harming, or you’re concerned they might be, it can be incredibly worrying and upsetting for you as their parent.</strong><strong> The important thing to remember is that you and your child are not alone - lots of young people go through this and come out the other side with different ways of coping with their feelings.</strong> <i class= "text-effra-light-orange">On this page, you can find out how to support your child and where to find professional help.</i></p>
  
  <h3> Why do young people self-harm? </h3>
  <p> <strong class= "text-jubilat-bold-orange">Self-harm is usually a way of trying to manage very difficult feelings.</strong> People often self-harm when life feels hard to cope with – when lots of distressing feelings have built up and it’s become overwhelming. <strong class= "text-effra-regular">In the moment, the sensation of self-harming and experiencing some physical pain can feel easier than feeling out of control emotionally. </strong> <i> If a young person is self-harming, it’s often a sign that something in their life isn’t quite right or has become too much to deal with. It can be understood as an important message about how a young person is feeling – one that needs to be noticed with care by the adults around them.</i><strong class= "text-effra-bold-orange"> Some myths you might hear about self-harm can make it harder to talk about as a parent – including that it’s a ‘phase’ young people go through, or that it’s an attention-seeking behaviour.</strong> While it might feel hard to understand sometimes from the outside, self-harm can be a way for a young person to: </p>
  
  <ul> 
    <li> <i class= "text-effra-bold"> Manage, reduce or express very strong and upsetting emotions – such as hurt, sadness, anger, fear or feeling bad about themselves</i></li>
    <li> relieve tension and pressure, or reduce feelings of panic and anxiety and temporarily feel calmer </li>
    <li> <strong class= "text-effra-bold-orange"> Experience a feeling of physical pain to distract from emotional pain</strong></li>
    <li> <i>Gain a sense of control over feelings or problems – for example, by feeling there’s something they can do when things feel too much</i></li>
    <li> <strong class= "text-effra-light-orange"> Stop feeling numb or ‘zoned-out’ – which can be a protection mechanism our bodies use when we’re experiencing overwhelming feelings</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong class= "text-jubilat-bold-orange"> >However, while it often feels like self-harm brings some relief in the moment, this is only temporary. As feelings build up again, so does the urge to self-harm. </strong> As this cycle continues over time, a young person may start to feel ashamed, confused or frightened about the fact that they’re self-harming – increasing the load they’re carrying on top of what they’re already going through. <i class= "text-effra-light"> This can become a cycle that’s really hard to break, and a habit that’s hard to stop.</i></p>
